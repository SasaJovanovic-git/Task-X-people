 Please find at least 5 potential code issues and be able to explain the reason behind it.

1 - using System; using System.Collections.Generic; 
	(it is not needed because it is not used)
2 - public string Title { get; set; }
	(title.get is never used)
3 -   public string Text { get; set; }
	(text.get is never used)
4 - var xdoc = XDocument.Parse(input);
	(unknown symbol - "input")
5 - var serializedDoc = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(doc);
	(unknown symbol - "Jsonconvert")
6 -  sw.Write(serializedDoc);
	(undeclared local variable)


These would be current problems at the very beginning that would be eliminated by installing certain libraries, e.g. Newtonsoft.Json, etc.
